# 🔆 Blynk-UV-Sterilization-ESP8266

## 📖 Description
This project implements an indoor monitoring and UV sterilization system using a **NodeMCU ESP8266** and a **DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor**. The NodeMCU acts as the main controller and provides Wi-Fi connectivity for remote monitoring and control via the **Blynk platform**. The system is developed using the **Arduino IDE** and aims to improve indoor environmental safety while minimizing human exposure to UV radiation.

## ⚙️ Main Components
- NodeMCU ESP8266  
- DHT11 Sensor  
- UV Lamp  
- Relay Module  

## 🛠️ Software
